# osbuild-rs

`osbuild-rs` is a reimplementation of [osbuild](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild) and provides build pipelines for operating systems. The [osbuild project](https://osbuild.org) deals with building operating systems, `osbuild-rs` is the lowest level of multiple projects involved.

> OSBuild is a pipeline-based build system for operating system artifacts. It defines a universal pipeline description and a build system to execute them, producing artifacts like operating system images, working towards an image build pipeline that is more comprehensible, reproducible, and extendable.

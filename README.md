Build-Pipelines for Operating System Artifacts in Rust

The osbuild-rs project provides native access to build-pipelines for
operating system artifacts from within the Rust programming language. It is
used by OSBuild to run the pipeline engine and implement the individual
stages of the build process.

See the [OSBuild Project](https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild) for information
on how to access and invoke build-pipelines, as well as further information
on integration into the wider OSBuild Ecosystem.
